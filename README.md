University Time Table generator
Time table scheduling is a multi-constrained, combinatorial optimization problem. 
How might we provide the administrator with a convenient platform to handle the above mentioned problem.
The main objective of this research is to schedule courses to fully utilize available resources by assigning the course to lecturer at correct time slot and place to appropriate event. 
The timetabling constraints are many and varied.
